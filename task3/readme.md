# Task 3

**The vbdValue() shown on bottom left of the TFT display is the value for N which gives a tick period of 1 second! (Why?)**

Since the input N into the clktick module is the vbdValue().

**FOR TICK PERIOD 1, N = 25**

## Challenge

N had to be changed to 46 - possibly to the fact that the bitwise opeation and reading of the poteniometer took up a lot of time.
